Aspirin 325mg immediately\n2. Nitroglycerin if systolic BP >100mmHg\n3. Morphine for pain control\n4. Beta-blockers if no contraindications\n5. Consider PCI or thrombolytics based on presentation ## Risk Stratification\nHigh risk features:\n- ST elevation on ECG\n- Elevated troponins\n- Hemodynamic instability\n- New onset heart failure ## Follow-up\nAll patients with chest pain should have:\n- Cardiac stress testing within 72 hours\n- Echocardiogram if indicated\n- Lipid panel and HbA1c if diabetes\n- Smoking cessation counseling",
