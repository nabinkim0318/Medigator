## Top 10 Take-Home Messages
1. **Chest Pain ≠ Chest Only**
   Consider pain/pressure in chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, abdomen, jaw; also SOB/fatigue.
2. **hs-Troponin is Preferred**
   Use hs-cTn assays for MI diagnosis/exclusion; serial testing recommended.
3. **Early Care**
   Obtain ECG within 10 min for acute symptoms. Call EMS early.
4. **Shared Decision-Making**
   Stable patients should be involved in testing/admission decisions.
5. **Low-Risk → No Urgent Testing**
   If 30-day MACE risk <1%, no urgent diagnostic testing is needed.
6. **Pathways Are Key**
   Use structured Clinical Decision Pathways (CDPs) routinely in ED/outpatient.
7. **Women Often Have Atypical Symptoms**
   Nausea, SOB, fatigue more common; risk of underdiagnosis.
8. **Test Patients Most Likely to Benefit**
   Intermediate/high-risk groups gain from imaging & further testing.
9. **Say “Noncardiac”, Not “Atypical”**
   Avoid “atypical chest pain” terminology.
10. **Structured Risk Assessment**
   HEART, EDACS, TIMI etc. to be applied systematically.

## Initial Evaluation
- **History:** Include onset, duration, triggers, associated features; avoid “atypical.”
- **Physical Exam:** Focused CV exam to identify ACS, aortic dissection, PE.
- **Diagnostic Testing:**
  - ECG in ≤10 min for acute chest pain.
  - Serial hs-cTn at 0h & 1–3h (or 3–6h if conventional troponin).
  - CXR if other thoracic causes suspected.

---

## Risk Stratification (ACS, Non-STEMI)
- **Low-risk:** <1% 30-day MACE → safe for discharge, no urgent testing.
- **Intermediate-risk:**
  - TTE useful bedside test.
  - CCTA reasonable for no known CAD; stress imaging if prior CAD.
- **High-risk:**
  - Ischemic ECG, troponin-positive, LV dysfunction, high CDP → invasive coronary angiography.

---

## Special Populations
- **Women:** Emphasize accompanying symptoms; underdiagnosis risk.
- **Older adults (>75):** Consider ACS if SOB, syncope, delirium, unexplained fall.
- **Diverse backgrounds:** Use interpreters & culturally competent care.
- **Dialysis:** Unremitting chest pain → EMS transfer.
- **Substance use:** Cocaine/methamphetamine → consider as etiology.

## Algorithms & Tools Referenced
- HEART, EDACS, TIMI pathways compared (Table 5).
- ESC hs-cTn 0/1h integrated into CDPs.
- “Warranty period”: normal angiogram (2y), normal stress test (1y).
- Patient-centric algorithm (Figure 7) for acute chest pain.

## Key Cutoffs / Action Items
- **hs-cTn:**
  - Repeat at 1–3h (hs-cTn) or 3–6h (conventional).
  - A single hs-cTn below limit of detection at ≥3h onset can rule out MI.
- **ECG:** Repeat serially if suspicion persists.
- **Low-risk discharge:** HEART ≤3, EDACS <16, TIMI 0 + negative troponins.
