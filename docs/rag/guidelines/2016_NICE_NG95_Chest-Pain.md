## Overview
This guideline covers assessing and diagnosing recent chest pain in adults (≥18). It focuses on both **acute chest pain suspected of ACS** and **stable chest pain suspected of angina**, aiming for rapid, accurate diagnosis and management.

---
## Key Recommendations (Acute Chest Pain)
- **Immediate assessment:** Check pain status; refer to hospital urgently if ACS suspected and pain in last 12h with abnormal or unavailable ECG.
- **Symptoms suggesting ACS:** Chest pain >15min, associated with nausea, sweating, breathlessness, or haemodynamic instability.
- **ECG:** Take 12-lead ECG immediately; do not delay transfer. Repeat serial ECGs if suspicion persists.
- **Troponin testing:** Use high-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTn). A single undetectable value at presentation can rule out NSTEMI in low-risk patients. Always interpret in clinical context.
- **Do not rely on GTN response** for diagnosis. Do not exclude ACS if ECG normal.
- **Immediate management:** Provide aspirin 300mg, pain relief (GTN, opioids if MI suspected), avoid routine oxygen unless SpO₂ <94%.
- **Differential:** If ACS excluded, consider PE, aortic dissection, pneumonia, pneumothorax.

## Key Recommendations (Stable Chest Pain)
- **Clinical assessment:** Document pain characteristics, history, CV risk factors, perform physical exam.
- **Angina classification:**
  - Typical = 3 features (constricting discomfort, exertional, relieved by rest/GTN).
  - Atypical = 2 features.
  - Non-anginal = 0–1 feature.
- **Testing:**
  - Offer CT coronary angiography (≥64-slice) for typical/atypical angina or non-anginal with abnormal ECG.
  - Use functional imaging (MPS, stress echo, MR perfusion) if CT shows uncertain disease.
  - Invasive coronary angiography reserved if non-invasive inconclusive.
- **Do not use exercise ECG to diagnose/exclude stable angina in people without known CAD.**
- **Consider other diagnoses:** musculoskeletal, GI, anxiety if pain non-anginal.

---
## Implementation Notes
- Use **universal MI definition**: troponin rise/fall + symptoms/ECG/imaging evidence.
- Recognize sex differences in troponin thresholds (99th percentile).
- Provide clear information to patients, address anxiety, explain uncertainty.
- Avoid unnecessary radiation; consider CT only when clinically appropriate.

## Summary Snippets for Cards
- *"Initial ECG within 10 minutes of presentation; do not exclude ACS with a normal ECG."*
- *"Use hs-troponin 0/1h strategy; a single undetectable value can rule out NSTEMI in low-risk patients."*
- *"Offer CT coronary angiography (≥64-slice) first-line for stable angina assessment."*
- *"Do not use response to GTN as diagnostic; exclude other life-threatening causes if ACS unlikely."*
