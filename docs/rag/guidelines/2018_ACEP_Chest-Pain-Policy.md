## Key Clinical Questions & Recommendations

### 1. Risk Stratification at Presentation
- **Q:** In adults without ST-elevation ACS, can initial risk scores predict 30-day MACE?
- **A:**
  - **Level B:** HEART score (<3) is reliable to identify very low-risk patients (30-day MACE miss ≤2%).
  - **Level C:** TIMI score can also be used but less specific.

### 2. Troponin Testing (0–3h)
- **Q:** Can troponin testing within 3h predict low 30-day MACE?
- **A:**
  - **Level C:**
    - Conventional troponin at 0 & 3h in low-risk (HEART ≤3) → safe rule-out.
    - A single hs-cTn below limit of detection at arrival, or negative 0 & 2h hs-cTn, predicts low MACE.
    - Validated accelerated diagnostic pathways (ADPs) with non-ischemic ECG + negative serial hs-cTn at 0 & 2h allow **early discharge**.

### 3. Further Diagnostic Testing Before Discharge
- **Q:** In low-risk patients with MI ruled out, does routine stress testing or CCTA reduce 30-day MACE?
- **A:**
  - **Level B:** **Do NOT routinely use** further testing prior to discharge.
  - **Level C:** Safe discharge with follow-up in 1–2 weeks. If no follow-up available → consider testing or observation.

### 4. Antiplatelet Therapy in NSTEMI
- **Q:** Should NSTEMI patients receive immediate antiplatelet therapy (P2Y12, GP IIb/IIIa) in ED in addition to aspirin?
- **A:**
  - **Level C:** P2Y12 inhibitors and GP IIb/IIIa may be given in ED **or deferred** until cath.
  - Evidence:
    - **Clopidogrel** reduces MI but increases bleeding.
    - **Prasugrel early**: no 30-day MACE reduction, ↑ bleeding.
    - **GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors**: no clear benefit, ↑ bleeding.

---

## Practical Take-Home Points
- HEART ≤3 + negative troponin (0 & 3h, or 0 & 2h if hs-cTn) → ≤2% 30-day MACE.
- Acceptable “miss rate” for MACE: ~1% (benchmark).
- Low-risk patients can be **safely discharged without stress testing** if follow-up assured.
- Antiplatelet beyond aspirin can be deferred if bleeding risk high.
- Key: structured ADPs, risk score + serial troponin + ECG.
