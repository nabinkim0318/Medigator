## Overview
The **European Society of Cardiology (ESC)** 2020 guidelines recommend a **0/1h algorithm** using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) for rapid triage of suspected **non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)** in the emergency department.
This paper validates and adapts the algorithm for a Chinese population (AnZhen cohort).

## ESC 0/1h Algorithm (Standard)
- **Rule-in criteria:**
  - 0h hs-cTnI ≥ 50 pg/mL **OR**
  - Δ1h (change after 1h) ≥ 15 pg/mL
- **Rule-out criteria:**
  - 0h hs-cTnI < 4 pg/mL (if chest pain onset >3h) **OR**
  - 0h < 5 pg/mL **AND** Δ1h < 4 pg/mL
- **Observation:** Patients not meeting rule-in or rule-out stay for further 3h monitoring.

**Performance (ESC standard applied to Chinese cohort):**
- NPV: 98.1%
- Sensitivity: 95.2%
- PPV: 85.4%
- Specificity: 95.8%【52†s44325-025-00080-8†L300-L315】

## AnZhen 0/1h Adaptation (Chinese cohort)
To improve accuracy, adjusted cut-offs were tested:

- **Rule-in:** 0h ≥ 50 pg/mL OR Δ1h ≥ 18 pg/mL
- **Rule-out:** 0h < 3–4 pg/mL (if onset >3h) OR Δ1h < 3 pg/mL

**Performance (AnZhen-02 terminal version):**
- NPV: 99.5%
- Sensitivity: 98.8%
- PPV: 86.4%
- Specificity: 96.1%【52†s44325-025-00080-8†L400-L418】

## Clinical Notes
- **Strengths:** Faster discharge, reduced ED length of stay, high diagnostic accuracy.
- **Observation group:** Use 3h values (Δ3h ≥ 17.5 pg/mL) for additional triage.
- **Limitations:** Ethnic and assay-dependent cut-offs, small sample size, renal function confounding.
- **Follow-up prognosis:** Higher MACCE rates in rule-in and observe groups vs. rule-out【52†s44325-025-00080-8†L500-L515】.

## Summary Snippets for Hackathon Cards
- *"ESC 0/1h hs-troponin algorithm: Rule-in ≥50 pg/mL or Δ1h ≥15 pg/mL; Rule-out <5 pg/mL and Δ1h <4 pg/mL."*
- *"AnZhen 0/1h adaptation improved NPV (99.5%) and PPV (86.4%) in Chinese patients."*
- *"Observation group requires 3h repeat troponin testing to avoid missed diagnoses."*
