## Overview
The **EDACS** was developed to identify low-risk chest pain patients suitable for **early discharge** from the emergency department.
It combines a clinical score (EDACS) with ECG and serial troponin testing to form the **EDACS-Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol (ADP)**.

---
## EDACS Score Components
- **Age (10 groups, 2–20 pts):** 18–45 (+2) up to ≥86 (+20)
- **Male sex:** +6
- **18–50y with ≥3 CAD risk factors or prior CAD:** +4
- **Symptoms/Signs:**
  - Diaphoresis: +3
  - Radiation to arm/shoulder: +5
  - Pain with inspiration: −4
  - Pain reproducible on palpation: −6

**Cut-off:** **EDACS <16** → potential low-risk (when combined with negative troponins & non-ischemic ECG).

## EDACS-ADP (Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol)
Criteria for safe early discharge:
1. **EDACS <16**
2. **No new ischemic changes on ECG**
3. **Negative 0h and 2h troponins**

If all met → classify as **low risk**, suitable for discharge with follow-up.

## Validation Results
- **Derivation cohort (n=1974):**
  - Low risk: 42.2%
  - Sensitivity: 99.0%
  - Specificity: 49.9%

- **Validation cohort (n=608):**
  - Low risk: 51.3%
  - Sensitivity: 100%
  - Specificity: 59%

- Interrater reliability: ICC = 0.87

---
## Clinical Notes
- Identifies **~50%** of ED chest pain patients as safe for early discharge.
- Maintains **≥99% sensitivity** for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days.
- Reduces unnecessary admissions and testing, improves ED flow.
- Further RCTs suggested before widespread implementation.

## Summary Snippets for Hackathon Cards
- *"EDACS <16 + negative ECG/troponins → early discharge safe, 30-day MACE <1%."*
- *"Validation: 51% patients classified low risk with 100% sensitivity for MACE."*
- *"EDACS-ADP halves admissions compared to prior rules while maintaining safety."*
