## Overview
The **TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score** was developed for patients with **Unstable Angina (UA) and Non–ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)**.
It predicts the risk of **all-cause mortality, new/recurrent MI, or urgent revascularization** within 14 days.

---
## TIMI Score Components (1 point each)
1. Age ≥65 years
2. ≥3 risk factors for CAD (e.g., HTN, DM, smoking, hyperlipidemia, family history)
3. Known CAD with stenosis ≥50%
4. ST-segment deviation ≥0.5 mm
5. ≥2 anginal events in past 24h
6. Aspirin use in past 7 days
7. Elevated cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin, CK-MB)

**Total:** 0–7 points.

---
## Results & Prognosis
- **Risk increases with higher scores:**
  - Score 0–1 → ~4.7% event rate
  - Score 2 → ~8.3%
  - Score 3 → ~13.2%
  - Score 4 → ~19.9%
  - Score 5 → ~26.2%
  - Score 6–7 → ~40.9%【94†Cardiovascular-NSTEMI-CD.pdf†L151-L159】

- Provides a **simple bedside tool** to stratify risk in UA/NSTEMI patients.
- Higher scores strongly associated with need for early invasive management.

---
## Clinical Notes
- Widely validated and incorporated into **ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines**.
- Easy to use, requires only basic clinical and lab data.
- Helps guide decisions regarding **admission, monitoring, antiplatelet/anticoagulation, and early angiography**.
- Not intended for ST-elevation MI (STEMI).
