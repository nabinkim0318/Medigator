## Overview
The **HEART score** (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin) was designed to stratify risk in patients presenting with **acute chest pain** in the emergency department (ED).
This multicenter, prospective validation study included **2,440 unselected patients** across 10 Dutch hospitals. The primary endpoint was **major adverse cardiac events (MACE)** within 6 weeks.

---
## HEART Score Components
- **History:** Highly suspicious (2), Moderately (1), Slight/none (0)
- **ECG:** ST-depression (2), Nonspecific (1), Normal (0)
- **Age:** ≥65 (2), 45–64 (1), ≤45 (0)
- **Risk factors:** ≥3 or known atherosclerosis (2), 1–2 (1), None (0)
- **Troponin:** ≥3× ULN (2), 1–3× ULN (1), ≤ULN (0)

**Total:** 0–10 points.

## Results
- **Low risk (0–3):** 36.4% of patients, **MACE 1.7%** (NPV >98%).
- **Intermediate (4–6):** 46.1% of patients, **MACE 16.6%**.
- **High risk (7–10):** 17.5% of patients, **MACE 50.1%**.
- **Discrimination:** C-statistic 0.83 (HEART) vs TIMI 0.75, GRACE 0.70【87†PIIS016752731300315X.pdf†L2155-L2158】.

---
## Clinical Notes
- HEART outperformed TIMI and GRACE in chest pain cohorts.
- Quick to calculate, based on admission data (ECG, troponin, history, risk factors, age).
- **Low-risk group**: candidates for early discharge.
- **High-risk group**: aggressive management advised.
- **Intermediate-risk group**: requires further testing and monitoring.
- HEART has advantages over TIMI/GRACE as it was designed specifically for undifferentiated ED chest pain.

## Summary Snippets for Hackathon Cards
- *"HEART = History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin; scored 0–10."*
- *"Low-risk (0–3): 1.7% MACE; High-risk (7–10): 50% MACE."*
- *"Outperforms TIMI and GRACE for chest pain patients in the ED."*
