## Overview
The **Wells score** and **Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC)** are widely used to guide decision-making for suspected **pulmonary embolism (PE)** in the emergency setting.
They help clinicians safely exclude PE in low-risk patients without the need for imaging or D-dimer testing.

## Wells Score (for PE)
Assigns points based on clinical features:

- Clinical signs of DVT: **+3**
- PE more likely than alternative: **+3**
- HR >100 bpm: **+1.5**
- Immobilization ≥3d or surgery <4w: **+1.5**
- Previous DVT/PE: **+1.5**
- Hemoptysis: **+1**
- Malignancy (active or recent): **+1**

**Interpretation:**
- >6 = High probability (~78%)
- 2–6 = Moderate (~28%)
- <2 = Low (~3.4%)【102†Bookshelf_NBK556663.pdf†L100-L110】

## PERC Rule (8 Criteria)
Applies to **low clinical suspicion (<15%)** cases. If **all criteria negative**, PE can be ruled out without further testing.

Criteria (must all be “No”):
1. Age ≥50 years
2. HR ≥100 bpm
3. O₂ sat <95% (room air)
4. Hemoptysis
5. Estrogen use
6. Prior DVT/PE
7. Recent surgery/trauma (≤4w)
8. Unilateral leg swelling

**If all negative → PE can be safely excluded.**

## Clinical Notes
- **Wells:** Risk stratification; combined with D-dimer testing for intermediate/low risk.
- **PERC:** Avoids unnecessary testing in very low-risk patients.
- Both validated in multiple cohorts, recommended in guidelines.
- Overuse of imaging (CTPA) can be reduced by correct application.
- Not a substitute for clinical judgment.

## Summary Snippets for Hackathon Cards
- *"Wells score ≥6 = high risk (78% PE); <2 = low risk (3.4%)."*
- *"PERC: 8 bedside criteria; if all negative and low suspicion, PE safely excluded."*
- *"Use Wells + D-dimer for moderate risk; PERC for very low risk to avoid over-testing."*
