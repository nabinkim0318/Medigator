## Overview
This systematic review/meta‑analysis evaluates the **0/1‑hour algorithm** using **high‑sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‑cTn)** for ruling out **NSTEMI** in ED chest‑pain patients. It summarizes pooled diagnostic performance and compares assay‑specific thresholds and delta criteria.

---
## Algorithms & Cut‑offs (Typical Patterns)
- **Rule‑out:** very low 0h hs‑cTn (often <LoD or low absolute value) and/or **Δ1h** below a small threshold, with symptom onset typically **>3h** for single‑sample strategies.
- **Rule‑in:** markedly elevated 0h hs‑cTn and/or **Δ1h** above a higher threshold.
- **Observe:** values between rule‑in and rule‑out → extended sampling (e.g., 3h).

> Assay‑specific cut‑offs (e.g., Abbott Architect hs‑cTnI, Roche hs‑cTnT) differ; local lab validation is essential.

## Key Findings (High‑level)
- **Rule‑out safety:** Pooled **NPV is very high** (≈99% or higher) with low miss rates when applied appropriately to low‑intermediate risk ED cohorts.
- **Speed:** Substantial reduction in ED length‑of‑stay using 0/1h vs. conventional 3–6h protocols.
- **Assay & timing:** Performance depends on the assay used and time from symptom onset; single‑sample strategies generally require ≥3h from onset.
- **Integration:** Best used within structured **Clinical Decision Pathways (CDPs)** alongside ECG and clinical risk scores (HEART/EDACS).

---
## Clinical Notes
- **Serial sampling matters:** 0/1h (or 0/2h) serial testing is safer than single‑sample approaches in early presenters.
- **Renal dysfunction & chronic myocardial injury** can elevate baseline hs‑cTn → interpret deltas and clinical context.
- **Sex‑specific 99th percentiles** may improve accuracy in some settings.
- **Document assay name and units** in every pathway to avoid threshold errors.

## Summary Snippets for Hackathon Cards
- *"0/1‑h hs‑troponin algorithms achieve ≈99% NPV for MI rule‑out in appropriate ED cohorts."*
- *"Use assay‑specific cut‑offs and Δ1h; extend to 3h if in the observe zone or early presenters."*
- *"Embed within CDPs with ECG + HEART/EDACS to minimize misses and unnecessary admissions."*
