## Overview
Early and repeated 12‑lead **ECG** is central to ED chest‑pain evaluation. This summary compiles practical timing and interpretation points frequently cited across ED evaluation reviews and guidelines.

---
## Initial ECG
- **Timing:** Acquire a **12‑lead ECG within 10 minutes** of arrival for suspected ACS.
- **Content:** Look for **ST‑elevation** (STEMI), **new ischemic changes** (ST‑depression/T‑wave inversion), **new LBBB**, ventricular arrhythmias.
- **Pitfalls:** A **normal initial ECG does not exclude ACS**—especially with ongoing symptoms or high clinical suspicion.

---
## Repeat / Serial ECG
- **When to repeat:** Persistent/recurring symptoms, initial nondiagnostic ECG, dynamic pain, or rising hs‑cTn.
- **Intervals:** Commonly at **15–30 minutes** if symptoms evolve; otherwise pair with troponin sampling (**0/1–2–3h**).
- **Leads:** Consider **posterior (V7–V9) and right‑sided** leads for suspected posterior/right ventricular ischemia.
- **Special cases:** LBBB/paced rhythm—use **Sgarbossa/modified Sgarbossa** criteria.

---
## Clinical Notes
- Combine ECG evolution with **hs‑cTn deltas** to distinguish acute injury from chronic elevation.
- In **PE, pericarditis, early repolarization**, ECG abnormalities may mimic ischemia—interpret with clinical context.
- **Documentation:** Include timing stamps for each ECG to correlate with hs‑cTn draws.

## Summary Snippets for Hackathon Cards
- *"Obtain 12‑lead ECG within 10 minutes; normal ECG ≠ rule‑out ACS."*
- *"Repeat ECG at 15–30 min if symptoms evolve or initial tracing is nondiagnostic."*
- *"Use posterior/right‑sided leads when indicated; apply (modified) Sgarbossa in LBBB/paced rhythms."*
