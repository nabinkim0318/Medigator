## Overview
A substantial proportion of chest‑pain presentations are **noncardiac**. This summary highlights common etiologies and bedside clues to help differentiate from ACS, guiding safe discharge and targeted follow‑up.

## Common Etiologies & Bedside Clues
- **Musculoskeletal (costochondritis, strain):** Localized tenderness reproducible on palpation; pain with movement or deep inspiration; normal ECG/troponin.
- **GERD/esophageal spasm:** Burning/retrosternal discomfort, post‑prandial, recumbency‑related; relief with antacids/PPIs.
- **Anxiety/panic:** Pleuritic/atypical chest tightness, hyperventilation, paresthesias; normal cardiac workup.
- **Pulmonary (pneumonia, pneumothorax):** Pleuritic pain, fever/cough or sudden dyspnea; abnormal CXR/US.
- **Herpes zoster (pre‑eruptive):** Dermatomal burning pain preceding rash.
- **Pericarditis:** Sharp, pleuritic pain improved by sitting forward; diffuse ST‑elevation/PR‑depression.

## Management Pointers
- Rule out life‑threatening causes (ACS, PE, aortic syndromes, tension PTX) first.
- Provide **clear discharge instructions**: return if pain worsens, syncope, dyspnea, or new symptoms.
- Trial **PPI** for suspected GERD; **NSAIDs + rest** for MSK pain; address **anxiety** with brief counseling and follow‑up.

## Summary Snippets for Hackathon Cards
- *"Reproducible chest wall tenderness → favors musculoskeletal cause."*
- *"Post‑prandial burning pain responding to antacids → suggests GERD."*
- *"Always exclude time‑critical diagnoses (ACS/PE/aortic) before labeling noncardiac."*
