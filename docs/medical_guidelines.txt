# Medical Guidelines for Chest Pain Assessment

## Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
Chest pain that worsens with exertion and improves with rest is highly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Key features include:
- Radiation to left arm, jaw, or back
- Associated symptoms: diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting
- Risk factors: age >65, diabetes, hypertension, smoking
- Immediate ECG and cardiac enzymes required

## Treatment Protocol
For suspected ACS:
1. Aspirin 325mg immediately
2. Nitroglycerin if systolic BP >100mmHg
3. Morphine for pain control
4. Beta-blockers if no contraindications
5. Consider PCI or thrombolytics based on presentation

## Risk Stratification
High risk features:
- ST elevation on ECG
- Elevated troponins
- Hemodynamic instability
- New onset heart failure

## Follow-up
All patients with chest pain should have:
- Cardiac stress testing within 72 hours
- Echocardiogram if indicated
- Lipid panel and HbA1c if diabetes
- Smoking cessation counseling
